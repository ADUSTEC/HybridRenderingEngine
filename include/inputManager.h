PURPOSE      : Read and process user input for the given frame and distinguish between
               input meant for the GUI and input meant for the camera controls.
SPECIAL NOTES: Currently, mouse wheel as a way of change field of view is disabled since
               changes in the field of view require a rebuilding of the view frustum 
               clusters. It is a low priority feature.
