HRE is a real-time, Physically based, Clustered renderer built with OpenGL and based on the techniques described on the paper [Clustered Deferred and Forward shading](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~uffe/clustered_shading_preprint.pdf) by Ola Olsson, Markus Billeter and Ulf Assarsson. The aim of this project is to build a testing framework to showcase deferred and forward graphics techniques (hence the hybrid part) and to examine the strengths of Clustered shading. I wrote a lengthy blog post full of cool animations that can serve as an introduction to efficient rendering algorithms as well as a detailed guide of my implementation of Clustered Shading, so make sure to check it out [here!](http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/21/CG.html)

This algorithm was selected for its two major benefits over traditional deferred/tiled solutions: it allows for more freedom to choose forward or deferred shading paths as desired and is a better long term fit for the modern GPU performance trends. It has already been succesfully implemented in some of the best looking games of the last couple of years, with some notable examples being: [DOOM 2016](https://www.slideshare.net/TiagoAlexSousa/siggraph2016-the-devil-is-in-the-details-idtech-666), [Just Cause 3](http://www.humus.name/Articles/PracticalClusteredShading.pdf) and [Detroit: Become Human](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025420/Cluster-Forward-Rendering-and-Anti). 

## Download

Stable builds can be found on the [HRE releases](https://github.com/Angelo1211/HybridRenderingEngine/releases) page.

## Development Timeline & Planned Features

The first development cycle began September 2018 and concluded December 2018 with the inclusion of Image Based Lighting and the release of the first stable version: HRE 0.01 "Aachen". For the next couple of months I'll be tackling the issues outlined in the [Projects section](https://github.com/Angelo1211/HybridRenderingEngine/projects) beginning with fixes for the remaining non-critical bugs and then moving on to a major re-write of the material system. The following is a a list of the engine features I aim to include over the coming months, it's obviously subject to change and all that stuff. 

#### Update #1: Materials & Shadow Mapping
 * Full material system re-write to decouple mesh & textures.
 * Implementing a shadow mapping atlas and automatic shadow map reuse.
 * Fix some unneccessary STL calls.

#### Update #2: Deferred / Screen Space Effects
* Rewriting screen space fragment shaders as compute shaders
* Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
* Screen Space Reflections
* Temporal AA
* Improved Color Grading & Tone Mapping

#### Update #3: Cluster Optimizations
* Large amounts of lights via BVH construction
* Advanced environment mapping
* View Frustum culling
* Compute shader based particles
* Include Approaching Zero Driver Overhead (AZDO) principles 

I'll be writing accompanying blog posts at the end of each major milestone, outlining the new features and their implementations and any complications I found along the way. Meanwhile, [Here's the first post](http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/21/CG.html) which contains an overview of other traditional rendering algorithms and builds the case for Clustered rendering.

## Dependencies 

In my previous project, [SSGE](https://github.com/Angelo1211/SoftwareRenderer), I made an effort to reduce the amount of dependencies to a minimum. This time however, the pendulum has swung the other way and I've made no restriction whatsoever (within reason) as to what libraries I could include in the project. I did this because I wanted to get more comfortable with the process of including and working with external libraries in C++.

Here's a list of the libraries currently included in the project:

* [ASSIMP](https://github.com/assimp/assimp): Mesh and material loading.
* [dear imgui,](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui): Immediate Mode GUI.
* [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad): GL loader-generator.
* [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json): Scene description and serialization.
* [OpenGL Image (GLI)](https://github.com/g-truc/gli): Image loading for DDS files.
* [OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html): Linear algebra / matrix library.
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php): Hardware abstraction layer.
* [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb): Image loading/decoding for JPG, PNG, HDR.

Here's a list of the libraries **not** included:

* [CMake](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake): Build generation.
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/): All things GPU & graphics.

All included libraries are represented here under their respective licenses which can be found in the links above or in the licenses.txt doc in the libs folder.

Thank you to all the 3D & texture artists who have made their assets free to use and so beautiful to look at. If it weren't for you guys I'd probably still be staring at the same old boring utah teapot all damn day!  

If I've mis-acknowledged, misattributed, or missed any references, please, create a new GitHub issue or send me a DM on Twitter and I'll make sure to fix it immediately.
